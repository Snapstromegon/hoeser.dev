A wise man once said "If you want to be a really good developer, be prepared for continuous learning" ([Golo Roden](theNativeWeb-topEntwickler)).

Once again I'm looking into something new that I've never done before. This time I'm looking into WebGPU and STL files.

:::commentBlock
I never worked with either of these ever before. I haven't even touched WebGL and have no experience in graphics programming, so really expect this to be a slow series as I learn in my free time about these massive topics.

## The goal of this series

I want to create a web renderer for STL files using WebGPU. How good this renderer becomes highly depends on how much time I find for writing and how well this series is received.

This series is also meant for you to follow me along as I learn new things. I'll try good hints for resources I found helpful along the way, but don't expect this to be a tutorial. The post probably will also include some mistakes at first, since I'm completely new to the topic.

## How will this work?

When I find the time, I will post updates to this series with what I did, how I did it and where you can learn more. Easiest way to stay up to date is probably to follow me on social media to see when I drop a new post.
Also feel free to reach out to me if you found an issue or want to provide feedback. I usually keep my DMs open (even on Twitter [when they allow me to](twitter-disable-dms)).

I will start this series by first looking into how STL files work and how to parse them in JS, then we will write a small renderer using the canvas API before taking a look at WebGPU and I don't know yet where we'll go from there.

## And now...

Have fun with the [first post](/blog/2023-07-23-stl-webgpu-1-stl-files/) where I explain how STL files work.
