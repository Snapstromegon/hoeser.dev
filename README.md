# Hoeser.dev

This is the source for me personal website [hoeser.dev](https://www.hoeser.dev).

The site is a PWA build with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and [LIT](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
Take a look at the lighthouse report - it's straight 100s.

On this site you find me chatting about web development and other stuff I find interesting.
